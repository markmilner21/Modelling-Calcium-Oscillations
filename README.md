# Modelling-Calcium-Oscillations
This repository contains the code corresponding to the analysis of the minimal model provided in the paper titled, 'Minimal model for signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations and their frequency encoding through protein phosphorylation by Goldbeter, Dupont and Berridge in 1990. The analysis is perform on XPPAUT.
